Todo Evolution – Phase I is a command-line Todo application built using a spec-driven, AI-assisted development approach with Gemini. This project demonstrates the evolution of software from a simple in-memory Python script to a fully functional CLI tool. It implements all core Todo functionalities—Add, View, Update, Delete, and Mark Complete/Incomplete—while following clean code principles and a modular architecture. Each feature is developed based on detailed specifications, showcasing how AI can accelerate development without writing boilerplate code. This project is designed for educational and hackathon purposes, emphasizing maintainability, scalability, and professional coding practices.
